# Object Oriented Programming: assignment 2:
## this assignment was coded, edited and solved by:
### 1.**Bar Ben Amo.**
### 2.**Dror Tapiero.**
### 3.**Chaya Blank.**
#### the assignment has two main parts: the data structure creation, and the Pokemon game design.
Part 1:
=======
the data structure that the assignment is built on is an directional weighted graph.
for info about this type of graph you can visit: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph].
the process of building this data structrue was to implement and program the interfaces sent by Boaz-Ben-Moshe.
here are the classes of this data structure:
| class | description |
| ------|:-----------:|
| nodeData| represents a vertex on the grap |  
| edgeData| represent an edge which connets two different node |
| GeoLocation| represents a 3 coordinates point |
| DWGraph_DS | represents an graph based on the nodes and edges |
| DWGraph_Algo | a data structure based on the DWGraph_DS structrue that offers variuos algorithms |

a display of each class and its variables:
